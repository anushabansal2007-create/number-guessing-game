# Project Overview

This project is a console-based Number Guessing Game created in Python. 
The computer generates a random number between a chosen range, and the player 
tries to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedback such as 
"Too High" or "Too Low" until the correct number is found.

## Objective of the Game
- To practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditions, and input.
- To demonstrate use of Git, VS Code, and GitHub.
- To build a simple, interactive console application.

## Technology Used
- Python (for logic)
- VS Code (for development)
- Git (version control)
- GitHub (repository hosting)
